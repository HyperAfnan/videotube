## Project Architecture Overview

This project follows a modular, service-oriented architecture, designed for scalability and maintainability. The structure separates concerns by feature and responsibility, making it easy to extend and test.

### Key Directories and Their Roles

- **docs/**  
  Contains project documentation, such as email flow descriptions.

- **public/**  
  Serves static assets (e.g., temporary files).

- **src/**  
  The main application source code, organized as follows:

  - **app.js & index.js**  
    Entry points for initializing and starting the application.

  - **components/**  
    Feature-based modules (e.g., user, video, tweet, comment, playlist, like, subscription, dashboard, health).  
    Each feature typically includes:

    - `*.controller.js`: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
    - `*.service.js`: Business logic and orchestration.
    - `*.model.js`: Data models (e.g., Mongoose schemas).
    - `*.route.js`: API route definitions.
    - `*.validator.js`: Input validation logic.

  - **config/**  
    Centralized configuration for environment variables, database, Redis, and Bull queue dashboard.

  - **jobs/queues/**  
    Defines background job queues (e.g., email, user) and their dead-letter handling.

  - **microservices/**  
    Contains worker processes for asynchronous tasks, such as:

    - Email processing (including templates and dead-letter handling)
    - User-related background processing

  - **middlewares/**  
    Custom Express middlewares for authentication, error handling, logging, file uploads, rate limiting, and validation.

  - **utils/**  
    Utility functions and helpers, including:
    - API error/response formatting
    - File handling
    - Logging (with environment-specific loggers)
    - Swagger API documentation setup

### Architectural Highlights

- **Modular Feature Design:**  
  Each domain (user, video, tweet, etc.) is encapsulated in its own folder, following the controller-service-model pattern for separation of concerns.

- **Background Processing:**  
  Uses Bull queues and dedicated microservice workers for handling asynchronous tasks (e.g., sending emails, processing user events), improving scalability and reliability.

- **Centralized Configuration:**  
  All environment, database, and queue configurations are managed in the `config/` directory for consistency and ease of management.

- **Robust Middleware Layer:**  
  Middleware components handle cross-cutting concerns, ensuring clean and reusable request processing.

- **Comprehensive Utilities:**  
  Utility modules provide reusable logic for error handling, logging, file operations, and API documentation.

This architecture supports clean code organization, easy feature addition, and robust background processing, making it suitable for scalable web applications.
